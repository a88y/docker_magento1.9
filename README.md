# docker

Just download the zip or use git clone.
Firstly you must install docker on your laptop or server.
This is working in linux and mac.

Install Docker : https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/

for the first time, you can use the shell script or the docker-compose.
./first_run.sh or docker-compose up -d (inside the directory folder)
i suggest to use docker-compose.

reference for install docker-compose : https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
